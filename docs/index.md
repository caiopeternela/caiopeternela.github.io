# Caio Peternela

### 1 - About me

I am Caio, a 19-year-old software engineering intern at Buser, a startup that aims to revolutionize the Brazilian road transport industry. I have been enthusiastic about technology and coding since a young age, creating my first website at 14, a single-page wiki about animes, specifically Naruto and Hunter x Hunter.

I am always learning and staying up-to-date with new technologies, with a particular interest in open-source software. I am eager to contribute to the open-source community and create useful tools for others while also growing professionally.

My career aspirations include working at startups, big tech companies, and eventually starting my own business. I am excited about the opportunity to gain diverse experiences and develop a well-rounded skill set.
